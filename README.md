## Overview 

Sharing information between departments or business units ("domains") of a company is critical for success. Sharing and consuming data assets is more successful if data is shared as a product. A data product is a collection of related data objects plus metadata, such as a business description, ownership and contact information, service level objectives, data dictionary, and more.
